# Question

The endpoint `/api/data` is handled by the controller `serveData` below.

If I send a request to `/api/data?filter=frog`, how do I get the value of the query parameter `filter`?

```js
const serveData = (req, res, next) => {
  const filterValue = ???
  // use the filterValue and send back a response
}
app.get('/api/data', serveData);
```

# Answer
You would use req.query() to get the value.

You are correct that we can access query from the request however, the query is not a method but rather a property!
